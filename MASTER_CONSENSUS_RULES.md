# BETTING CONSENSUS COMPILER - ULTRA-STRICT RULES

## STEP 1: FILTER FOR TODAY ONLY - STRICT DATE CHECK
- ONLY include picks explicitly marked for current date being processed
- EXCLUDE: "for Tuesday", "July 1", "tomorrow", or any future date references
- EXCLUDE: NFL picks during June-August (off-season)
- EXCLUDE: Any pick without clear current-date confirmation

## STEP 2: CAPPER IDENTIFICATION - EXACT RULES
- Each unique name = 1 capper (Example: "CBLEZ" mentioned twice = same person, count once per bet)
- Numbered cappers 1-99 = separate individuals (Example: "Capper 14" ≠ "Capper 16")
- "Consensus Leans" = 1 entity total (not individual cappers)
- "Dimers" = 1 entity total
- Duplicate prevention: Same capper can only vote once per unique bet

## STEP 4: BET STANDARDIZATION - NO COMBINING
- "Team ML" ≠ "Team F5 ML" ≠ "Team -1.5" (count as completely separate bets)
- "Team +1.5" ≠ "Team ML" (different bet types, never combine)
- "Diamondbacks ML" ≠ "Diamondbacks +1.5" (separate entries in consensus)
- Same bet with different odds = same bet (Example: "Yankees ML -140" = "Yankees ML -134")

## STEP 5: UNIT CONVERSION - STANDARDIZE
- (10*) = 10 units
- 7u = 7 units
- Max bet = assume 10 units unless specified
- High unit threshold = 3+ units
- Units do NOT add extra votes to consensus count

## STEP 6: COUNTING RULES - ONE VOTE ONLY
- 1 vote per capper per unique bet (no exceptions)
- High unit plays get 🔥 but NO extra votes in overall consensus
- Parlays: each leg = 1 vote for that capper only (never double-count)
- If capper lists same bet multiple times = count once only

## STEP 7: 🔥 TAG RULES - AUTOMATIC APPLICATION
- Apply 🔥 if bet has 3+ cappers OR single bet is 3+ units
- Check every bet for 🔥 qualification
- No exceptions or missed applications

## STEP 8: PARLAY COMBO RULES - EXACT MATCHING
- Only include parlays where 2+ cappers have IDENTICAL combinations
- Single-capper parlays = excluded from parlay section
- Partial matches don't count (must be exact same legs)

## STEP 9: PLAYER PROP RULES - EXACT MATCHING
- Must be exact same player + exact same prop type + exact same line
- "Wheeler Under 5.5 Strikeouts" ≠ "Wheeler Under 5.5 Hits Allowed"
- Must be for games happening today
- Minimum 2 cappers with identical prop

## STEP 10: OUTPUT FORMAT (5 sections)

### 1. TOP 5 OVERALL CONSENSUS
Format: [Rank]. [Team] [Bet Type] [Line] – [X cappers] 🔥

### 2. TOP 5 HIGH UNIT PLAYS (3+ units)
Format: [Rank]. [Team] [Bet Type] [Line] – [X units] by [Capper]

### 3. TOP 5 PARLAY COMBOS (if any appear multiple times)
Format: [Rank]. [Full Parlay] – [X cappers]

### 4. TOP 3 PLAYER PROPS (if 2+ cappers agree on exact same prop)
Format: [Player Name] [Prop] [Line] – [X cappers]

### 5. TOP 3 BY SPORT (min 2 cappers per pick, only sports playing today)
- MLB:
- WNBA:
- NBA: (during season)
- NHL: (during season)
- NFL: (during season)

(Only show sports with games today and 2+ capper agreement)

## STEP 11: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Before finalizing output, verify:
- [ ] All dates filtered correctly
- [ ] No duplicate capper counting
- [ ] All 🔥 tags applied correctly
- [ ] No bet types combined inappropriately
- [ ] Unit conversions accurate
- [ ] Only today's games included

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Only count picks for games actually happening TODAY
- Each capper name/number gets ONE vote per unique bet
- Units in parentheses like (10*) = 10 units
- "u" after number = units (7u = 7 units)
- F5 = First 5 innings
- RL = Run Line
- TT = Team Total
- NRFI = No Run First Inning

## EXAMPLE CLARIFICATIONS:
- If "Rangers ML" appears 5 times from same capper = 1 vote
- If "Rangers ML" + "Rangers -1.5" both appear = 2 separate bets
- If bet has 3+ cappers OR 3+ units = gets 🔥 tag
- "Consensus Leans" with 3 picks = 1 capper total, not 3 cappers
