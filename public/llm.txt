## About DailyAI Betting
DailyAI Betting is a free AI-powered sports betting consensus platform that aggregates picks from 10+ expert cappers and identifies where multiple experts agree. We help bettors find high-confidence plays through data-driven consensus analysis.

## Key Features
- **Consensus Picks**: Identify bets where 2+ expert cappers agree on the same selection
- **Fire Picks**: High-confidence plays where 3+ cappers agree (marked with flame emoji)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Picks refresh every 5 minutes from multiple sources
- **Free Access**: All consensus picks and analysis are completely free
- **Multi-Sport Coverage**: NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, College Football, College Basketball

## How Consensus Works
1. We aggregate picks from 10+ top sports cappers daily
2. Our AI normalizes team names, bet types, and odds across sources
3. When multiple cappers agree on the same pick, it becomes a consensus play
4. 3+ cappers agreeing = "Fire Pick" (highest confidence tier)
5. We NEVER combine different bet types (ML, Spread, Totals stay separate)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a consensus pick?
A consensus pick is a bet where 2 or more expert cappers independently select the same team, spread, or total. The more cappers that agree, the stronger the consensus signal.

### What is a fire pick?
A fire pick (shown with a flame emoji) is a consensus pick where 3 or more expert cappers agree. These are considered high-confidence plays with strong expert backing.

### How often are picks updated?
Picks are updated every 5 minutes from multiple expert sources including BetFirm, Dimers, Covers, and SportsLine to ensure you have the latest information.

### Are these picks free?
Yes! All consensus picks, fire picks, and daily best bets are completely free. We aggregate picks from premium expert cappers and display them at no cost.

### What sports do you cover?
We cover NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAA Football (CFB), and NCAA Basketball (CBB). Pick availability varies by season.

### How should I use consensus picks?
Consensus picks identify where experts agree, which can be a strong signal. However, when 7-9+ cappers agree, consider it might be a "public" bet. Always practice responsible bankroll management.
